Project: A web platform for reservation of barbershops implemented in Django. 
In this platform barbers can have profiles and users (their clients) can comment on their performance and rate them. 
A real-world reservation and cancellation is possible through the platform. 
Searching through barbershops is also possible by different factors, like name and etc... .
